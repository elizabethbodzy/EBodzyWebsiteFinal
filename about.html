            <p class="my-description"> Here's a brief history of who I am, what I do, and why we should be friends or even work together... I am originally from Dallas, Texas and it was Junior year of high school that my creative talents truly emerged. I developed a passion and curiosity for Graphic Design, which would lead me to a Bachelor's of Fine Arts degree in Visual Communications from the University of Arizona. </p>
            <p class="my-description"> 2014 was life-changing. I had one degree down, but it was then that I realized I just wasn't ready to stop learning. I was interested in expanding my talents to a broader creative voice. </p>
            <p class="my-description"> The applications were submitted and the waiting game was endless. It was then, while on a trip to Chicago that I received the call that would change everything. I would be moving to New York to continue my education at one of the most prominent design schools in the country, Parsons The New School. August 2015 I would start my two year Master's journey in the Design and Technology program. </p>
            <p class="my-description"> The two years flew by. My experience at Parsons was incredible. The curriculum, faculty, and especially my fellow classmates challenged myself to grow as a designer.
               While many of my projects represent my learning and passion for product development and design, I have really learned that there are so many areas to tackle that will only help myself further my career. I love what I do and it only helps me continue to expand my creativity.
